                                                much of what I learned, I do have control over my body much better.

                                                have also been invited to perform at a dance club.

                                                learned the ballroom version of swing. I devoted much of my 2019 summer to practicing Swing, learning new techniques and gaining experience both leading and following.

                                                realized that the nursing homes could use some music, they put together videos from MINHUET members performing a piece in their homes. I sing Dream a Little Dream while 
                                                playing the ukulele at around 15 minutes.

                                            <p>During my freshman year of college at Harvard, I challenged myself to audition for a choir. I had no previous formal singing experience,
                                                but I always loved the idea of making music with others through singing. I got so nervous the last day of auditions, I almost didn't go, but at the last
                                                second my friend walked with me there and watched me sign up. I still have a strange block when singing in front of others, but joining the Radcliffe Choral Society
                                                taught me so much about singing, like how to sight-read, and I had so much fun touring with them to Texas.
